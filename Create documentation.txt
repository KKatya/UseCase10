This function, IsValidString, is a static method within the StringValidator class. It takes two parameters: input of type string and maxLength of type int. The function is responsible for validating whether the input string meets certain criteria.

The function begins by validating the input parameters. If the input is null or the maxLength is less than or equal to 0, the function returns false indicating invalid input.

The function then constructs a regular expression pattern using the maxLength parameter. The pattern is explained as follows:

^: Matches the start of the line.
(?=.*[a-z]): Positive lookahead. Ensures that at least one lowercase letter exists.
(?=.*[A-Z]): Positive lookahead. Ensures that at least one uppercase letter exists.
(?=.*\d): Positive lookahead. Ensures that at least one digit exists.
(?=.*[!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~])`: Positive lookahead. Ensures that at least one special character exists. The special characters are within the square brackets.
(?!.*\s): Negative lookahead. Ensures that no whitespace character exists.
.{1,maxLength}$: Matches any character with a length from 1 to maxLength until the end of the line.
The constructed regular expression pattern is then used with Regex.IsMatch to validate the input string.

If the input string matches the pattern, the function returns true, indicating that the string is valid according to the specified criteria. Otherwise, it returns false.

In summary, this function checks if a string meets certain criteria including having at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, one special character, no whitespace, and a length between 1 and maxLength.
